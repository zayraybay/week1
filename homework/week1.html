    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold my-4">Week 1 Homework Instructions</h2>
    <p class="my-4">Let's continue practicing building websites with HTML and pushing the completed code up to GitHub.</p>
    <p class="my-4">Your task is to build a website for marketing a business – real or fictional. For this week's assignment, the look-and-feel of the website doesn't matter, only the structure. You will be adding the design/look of the website in next week's assignment (by adding CSS).</p>
    <ol class="list-decimal list-inside">
      <li>The website should be for a business – it can be real or fictional, a startup or an established business.</li>
      <li>Create a new repository in your GitHub.com account. To make it easier for us to find, the repository should be named <strong><em>hw1</em></strong>. It should be a <strong>public</strong> repository and your code should ultimately live at
        <span class="bg-orange-100 text-red-400 font-mono p-1">https://github.com/&lt;your GitHub username&gt;/hw1</span>. <strong>Submit this URL as your "website URL" for this assignment in Canvas.</strong></li>
      <li>Clone this repository using VSCode. Create at least 3 HTML pages, connected via links; i.e. a consumer of your website should not need to know the file structure, rather, they can simply navigate between the pages using links. The "home page" should be named <span class="bg-orange-100 text-red-400 font-mono p-1">index.html</span>, and you should follow the <em>HTML Guidelines</em> as listed below. The other two pages can be for whatever makes sense – e.g. an "about us" page, "products" page, "benefits" page, etc.</li>
      <li>Create a file called <code>README.md</code> in the root of your project's code. In the contents of this file, write a quick description of your project. You'll know you did this right if your GitHub repository shows the contents of this file directly below the files.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold my-4">Linking the pages</h2>
    <p class="my-4">If all goes well, your directory structure should resemble something like this:</p>
    <pre><code>Your code folder
- hw1
-- index.html
-- page2.html
-- page3.html
</code></pre>
    <p class="my-4">The "home page" (i.e. what visitors will see when they go to your production site) <strong>must be named</strong>
      <span class="bg-orange-100 text-red-400 font-mono p-1">index.html</span>, and is the only filename that really matters. You can name the other files whatever you want.
    </p>
    <p class="my-4">Creating links between the pages is as simple
      as <span class="bg-orange-100 text-red-400 font-mono p-1">&lt;a href="page2.html"&gt;My second page&lt;/a&gt;</span>. Don't use "absolute" paths, for
      instance&nbsp;<span class="bg-orange-100 text-red-400 font-mono p-1">&lt;a href="C:\\code\username.github.io\page2.html"&gt;My second page&lt;/a&gt;</span>&nbsp; –
      just use the filename by itself. This is known as the "relative" path and works great, as long as the files are all in
      the same directory.</p>
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold my-4">HTML Guidelines</h2>
    <p class="my-4">You should use these elements at least once, and use proper indentation and spacing:</p>
    <ol class="list-decimal list-inside">
      <li>Headers (h1, h2, etc)</li>
      <li>p</li>
      <li>ul/li or table</li>
      <li>a</li>
      <li>img</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="my-4">In addition, your <span class="bg-orange-100 text-red-400 font-mono p-1">head</span> and <span class="bg-orange-100 text-red-400 font-mono p-1">body</span> should contain the correct elements. For instance, the "meat" of your HTML should reside within the <span class="bg-orange-100 text-red-400 font-mono p-1">body</span>, and your <span class="bg-orange-100 text-red-400 font-mono p-1">head</span> should only contain things like the page title, meta tags, and other elements that are not on the actual page.</p>
    
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold my-4">Rubric (10 points total)</h2>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
      <li>5 points: 3 distinct pages, linked by common navigation, and the links work on any computer, not just yours.</li>
      <li>5 points: HTML Guidelines implemented.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="my-4">Again, be sure to&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>submit your Github repository's URL via
          Canvas</strong></span><strong> - this is the ONLY way we will know what your Github username is and where your finished code lives!</p>
    <p class="my-4">Happy coding!</p>
