    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">Week 1 Lab Instructions</h2>
    <p class="my-4">Let's create a website! It won't look like much for now (wait until next week!), but we have to start somewhere. For this lab, our goal is to create a website with at least two pages, link the pages together with a common navigation, and commit and push our code to GitHub, so that we can share our code publicly.</p>
    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold">Getting Started with Git and GitHub</h3>
    <p class="my-4">We can think of Git like Dropbox, but for code files. <strong>Git</strong> is the open-source technology that powers it all; <strong>GitHub</strong> is a commercial hosted Git service – owned by Microsoft. Git&nbsp;<em>repositories</em>&nbsp;are folders on your computer that have&nbsp;<em>magic powers</em>. These powers include:</p>
    <ul class="list-inside list-disc">
      <li>The ability to automatically synchronize files within the folder between your computer and GitHub.com</li>
      <li>Watching for changes you make to files, then giving you the ability to either move forward with those changes, or revert back</li>
      <li>Collaborate with others on the same code, without stepping on toes</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="my-4 text-xl font-bold">Creating a Repository</h3>
    <p class="my-4">The first step to using Git and GitHub is creating a Git repository. The basic process is as follows:</p>
    <ol class="list-inside list-decimal">
      <li>Go to GitHub.com, make sure you're logged-in.</li>
      <li>Click the "New" button next to "Repositories", or from the "plus sign" in the top-right.</li>
      <li>Give your repository a name, keep it public, and click "New Repository".</li>
      <li>You should see the initial "quick setup" page.</li>
      <li>In VSCode, clone the repository the same way we cloned the in-class repository – start with a blank VSCode window, "Clone Repository" -> "Clone from GitHub", and select your main code directory as the location.</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="my-4">Once the repository is created, Git is always watching. If it detects that anything has changed
    in our repository folder, we'll see those changes in VSCode. We can then repeat the commit-and-push sequence to commit those changes and send them to GitHub.</p>
    <p class="my-4">Your mild-mannered, ordinary folder is now a REPOSITORY and fully synchronized with GitHub! You'll know everything went right if you see your changes at GitHub.com. Remember that your account at GitHub.com is
    public - if you can see it, I can see it... everyone can see it!</p>
    <h3 class="my-4 text-xl font-bold">Don't be that guy/gal/non-binary pal</h3>
    <p class="my-4">We will be creating a lot of code projects this quarter. You'll want to create a&nbsp;<em>new folder</em>, and
      subsequently, a&nbsp;<em>new repository</em> for each one of these projects. This lab is one of
      them. When we move on to creating new projects, each one of these is a
      <em>new repository</em>. Tips for avoiding trouble:</p>
    <p class="my-4"><strong>Don't put magic folders (repositories) inside other magic folders!!!</strong> If our directory structure looks like this:</p>
    <pre><code>Code Directory
-- mysite
  -- mysecondsite
  -- myteam
  -- weather
  -- poker</code></pre>
    <p class="my-4">... we will be sad. When we create new applications in class, be sure to create a new folder that lives directly
      underneath our code directory, and create a new GitHub repository for each one of them. Like this:</p>
    <pre><code>Code Directory
-- mysite
-- mysecondsite
-- myteam
-- weather
-- poker</code></pre>
    
    <h3 class="my-4 text-xl font-bold">Cloning an existing repository</h3> 
    <p class="my-4">We did this at the beginning of class, but just to document the process, so we have it for the future:</p>
    <ol class="list-decimal list-inside">
      <li>Open a new, blank VSCode window. File -> New Window is the easiest way. Click the Source Control (SCM) in left-hand sidebar.</li>
      <li>"Clone Repository"</li>
      <li>"Clone from GitHub" should give you a list of options from your GitHub account. Alternatively, enter GitHub repository URL, e.g. https://github.com/eng/hello-html</li>
      <li>Select a folder – find our "code" folder and "Select Repository Location" - this will create a new subfolder with all the
      code from the repository</li>
      <li>Would you like to open the cloned repository? <em>Yes, yes we would.</em> Select "Open"</li>
    </ol>

    <h3 class="my-4 text-xl font-bold">Committing and Pushing</h3>
    <p class="my-4">Once changes are made to your code – either new files are created, or changes are made to existing files, you'll want to commit and push those changes to GitHub. This is a two step process, both done within the "Source Control" tab in VSCode.</p>

    <ol class="list-decimal list-inside">
      <li><strong>Commit</strong> – you commit changes by writing a "commit message" – a brief summary of the work that you've done – and hitting the "check mark" icon.</li>
      <li><strong>Push</strong> – after you've committed your changes, hit the "three dots" icon and select "Push". This will take the changes you've committed and send them up to GitHub.</li>
    </ol>

    <hr class="my-8">
    
    <h3 class="my-4 text-xl font-bold">Building a simple profile page</h3>
    <ol class="list-decimal list-inside">
      <li>Create a new repository at GitHub.com. Call it <span class="bg-orange-100 text-red-400 font-mono p-1">hello-world</span>, clone and open it in VSCode.</li>
      <li>Create a new file named <span class="bg-orange-100 text-red-400 font-mono p-1">index.html</span>.</li>
      <li>Build a profile page (i.e. "about me" page or resume) using properly-formed HTML. Make it your own – include images, link to social media accounts, or whatever you like. Use the provided HTML cheatsheet to get an idea of some of the basic HTML elements and how to use them.</li>
      <li>Click the "Source Control" icon in the left-hand sidebar and commit and push the changes to GitHub (see "Committing and Pushing" above).</li>
      <li>Go to GitHub.com and verify that your code is there and publicly accessible (protip: use "Incognito Mode" to give it a quick test).</li>
      <li>Make changes to the page and commit and push again – make sure you're comfortable with this cycle, as we'll be doing this a lot this quarter.</li>
    </ol>
